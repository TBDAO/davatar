          NFTs are expensive enough, we shouldn't need to pay every time we want a fresh new look or throw on an old

          DAOvatars uses IPFS to update your ens profile photo with one of your NFTs. Pay for gas once then swamp and
          you can always come back to swap out for new trendy NFTs or an OG look you rocked in the past.
